üèÅ RoSctober 2024: The Open Source Developer Challenge is about to start

As part of the RoSctober Race presented by [Race of Sloths](https://race-of-sloths.com/), we recognized this repo to be highly valuable in the open-source movement.

Existing and new contributors will be rewarded proportionally to their contributions to the selected open-source projects. Read below for the official rules, and let‚Äôs see who will climb to the top of the Sloth Hall of Fame! ü¶•

## TLDR for maintainers:

- This issue is an invitation to join [Race of Sloths](https://race-of-sloths.com/) project
- To accept the invitation, comment `@race-of-sloths accept`
- Once the invitation is accepted, your contributors are eligible to get a share of $10,000 prize pool with their contributions to your project in October; they will just need to mention @race-of-sloths in their PR

## What is the RoSctober Race and Race of Sloths?

Our goal is to make the open-source contributions more fun and rewarding. We hope that for some contributors it will bring joy through participation in weekly and monthly quests, and boost their profiles by earning points and competing in the leaderboards - all in a non-intrusive way with just a couple of commands directly in GitHub interface. 

1. Your contributors are welcome to participate within your normal contribution flow
2. RoSctober Prize Pool: $10,000 USDC
3. Eligibility: Earn at least 100 SP during RoSctober to qualify for the prize
4. Competition Timeline: October 1st to October 31st, 2024
5. Submission Process for contributors: Tag @race-of-sloths in any comment on GitHub to automatically submit your PR
